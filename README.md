# PWA Demo
PWA Demo for DrupalCamp Krasnodar 2017

You may look at the application in action here: [kkomelin.github.io/pwa-demo](https://kkomelin.github.io/pwa-demo/).

Briefly, what it can:

1) **It works offline.**
When you're online and load it first time, it caches all resources except the Druplicon image.
When you load it while offline, it loads resources from cache, 
so that it's almost the same app, except the Druplicon images, which is replaced with an offline image.

2) **You can pin it** to your home screen through Chrome on Android or to your desktop through Chrome on Ubuntu. 
Chrome will actually advise you to do so if you visit the app a few times.
